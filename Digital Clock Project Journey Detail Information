📌 Project Journey – Digital Clock:

1. Start (Setup & Structure)

The project contains 4 files:

index.html – Structure of the clock (HTML skeleton).

style.css – Styling of the clock (colors, layout, animations).

script.js – Logic to display and update real-time clock.

README.md – Documentation (basic project info).

In index.html:

A <div id="time"> holds three circular sections for hours, minutes, and seconds.

Each circle has an SVG stroke animation and a dot that rotates like a clock hand.

The <script src="script.js"></script> links JavaScript to update the time dynamically.
